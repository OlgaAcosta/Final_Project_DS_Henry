      " I really wanted to like this place, but there was just too much bad for me to rate the place higher than one star and would be very hesitant in ever returning based on my first time experience.  Most likely a one and done for me.\n",
      "\n",
      "It all started when I ordered the Sunday Special of 10-Wings & a Pitcher of Beer for $15.99; not a great deal compared to other places, but it was what I wanted.  I ordered my wings extra crispy, naked, with sauce on the side; (I don't like soggy & under cooked wings, as most places have a habit of doing).  Two of the gents I was with, ordered wings as well, one ordered crispy, the other ordered them regular; and we all had different sauces and some with sauce on and some on the side. \n",
      "\n",
      "When our wings arrived, all three types of done-ness came out, but went to the wrong individuals.  My wings came out exactly how I DID NOT want them; they appeared to be light in color, texture and crispness, but seemed cooked enough to eat, and since I was hungry, I mistakenly dug in...Even though they were anything but extra crispy, plus they were smothered in sauce.  I didn't want to sit & wait for a corrected order to eventually come out, as my friends had all started to dig in and I didn't want them waiting on me...Huge mistake!.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Halfway into the second gooey wing with blood/juice running out, I decided they were not safe to eat without being cooked longer, so instead of making a big deal out of it, I just simply ordered what I thought would be quick half pressed Cuban sandwich for dine-in and then asked for a to-go box for the remaining undercooked wings, so I could finish cooking them at home.   Side Note:  To finish them at home, I ended up baking them at 425-degs for 5-mins on each side, THEN to crisp them up, I had to broil them at 500-degs for 4-mins each side...18-mins of extra cooking, that is how flipping undercooked they were.  I was honestly shocked & disgusted how undercooked & dangerous they were, AND that they would serve them to a customer!!!\n",
      "\n",
      "15-mins later my dine-in sandwich eventually arrived in a steamed up to-go box with soggy curly fries.  Since my friends were finished with their meals, finishing up their drinks, and asking for their checks, I figured I would at least eat the soggy fries and half of the Cuban while we waited.  When the checks arrived, I noticed my bill was substantial higher than everyone else's, even though I had ordered an additional meal, things were just not adding up.  After looking at all of our checks, I determined I was charged the normal price for wings & beer vs. the Sunday Special I had ordered.  The strange part was, my golf buddy's check was properly rung in depicting the Sunday Special, but Mine was not.  Plus, my check didn't even have the right type of beer I had ordered, so I'm not even sure if I got what I ordered.  My buddy realized I was getting pissed, (which is not like me AT ALL), so he ended up dealing with the bartender to get the check fixed, which allowed me to scarf down some of my reorder so no one had to wait on me.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once my \"corrected\" bill was brought out, I decided I would give the bartender the benefit of the doubt and still leave a tip, (but only 18% vs. the 30% I typically tip bartenders/servers).  While signing my credit card slip, I noticed the recommended tip printed on the bill was more than what I had calculated it would have been; which caused me to break out the calculator and compare all of our bills to figure out why my bill was incorrect once again.  As it turned out, everyone else's recommended tip amount was properly calculated on their receipts; however, mine was not.  After further inspection, I discovered instead of ringing in the Sunday Special, as she had correctly done on my buddy's check, the bartender just simply applied an equivalent dollar amount discount; therefore, by doing so, the recommended tip on the receipt was calculated based on the original amount, (before she added a discount vs. ringing the Sunday Special in correctly).  I'm talking about less than a dollar difference, (so what's the big deal right?); however, at this point, it's the principle of the matter and adding insult to injury.  Out of all the ineptness on the restaurant's part and too much niceness on my part,  I'm getting squeezed for what equates to roughly another $0.60...Ain't happening!\n",
      "\n",
      "Coming from the restaurant business and a sports bar at that, I have a VERY high tolerance for mistakes, typically appreciate my bartenders/servers, can tell if they are weeded or just lazy, and maybe all of this very well could have been honest mistakes made along the way of one visit by one customer out of many; (i.e., order coming out wrong, food being undercooked, waiting 15-mins for a reorder, reorder coming out in a to-go box with soggy fries, bill being rang in incorrectly, and the recommended tip printing out higher than it should have been because of being edited incorrectly).  2/3/18 @ 2:13pm / Check 75 / Table 61 / Server: KH\n"

      " (Translated by Google) I have been visiting the Place for a long time in large groups and many times alone with my partner because we like to go out to dinner ... and if I have time at my lunch I visit them.\n",
      "This time we had a very big disappointment with his service, with his touch and with his actions, which I think were in very bad taste. I explain.\n",
      "\n",
      "We ordered a take-away meal by phone, since we were visiting the place at our lunch hour, I mean 1 hour the main plan was to go pick up and return.\n",
      "When leaving work to go looking for food, other employees wanted to eat from there and we let them know that we would do them the favor of ordering their meals when we went to pick up ours, I arrive at the cashier, he explained that I have another order that Ask, that I wanted to place an order right there (fried cheese) and that I had other orders to order to take away. She explains to me that to order the fried cheese I have to ask for it at the table, that she would charge me what we already ordered and then I would go to sit at the table to order the fried cheese, that she will occasionally do the orders that I have to take me to the table. waitress, that she takes them as a go, and we pay the first order (even though I paid I gave them a tip because by custom since I was a waitress I know what the work for tip is and I am very aware of the employees in each place what visit)\n",
      "When we sit at the table after paying our first order,\n",
      "The waitress with a very bad attitude from the 1st and the waiter looked at each other with weird faces, then they shook each other,\n",
      "They stood in front of the cashier and started talking to each other, he brought me the cutlery and we asked him for 2 cokes and a fried cheese and I said he had some orders to do to go.\n",
      "At that time everyone looks at each other and the cashier goes to us 2 and tells us that we could not eat our previous purchase there, that if we had ordered it by phone we had to consume it outside the establishment and the waiter brings us a paper that says it (which I saw only when he brought it because we didn't even notice the paper but no such embarrassment happened) that that was a new law of them, that if I wanted to eat the fried cheese there I could order it but I couldn't take anything out of the previous order and if we wanted we could eat in the car or outside the establishment while we waited for the other orders but without consuming the ones we already had there, bone, letting our orders cool down.\n",
      "I very kindly got up from the seat and told them that thank you very much to everyone that we really did not have the knowledge of the new rule, we had not seen the paper and we did not know it (because they do not even let you know when they arrived at the establishment before to pay, or by the phone they tell you the rule, even we explaining what we wanted to do do not tell us until we take a seat)\n",
      "Well ... we had no choice, we left let you know that I was no longer interested in making any other purchases or taking orders to take because I would not eat in my car, or let the food cool down, we left my companion and I with faces of shame because they practically threw us out of the establishment in front of everyone.\n",
      "I think it was very bad taste the way they approached us and the way they dealt with the situation made me feel bad, as if we had brought food from another place (a macdonalds or a bk) to eat there when we were consumers in one way or another. Really neither the waitress, nor the waiter, nor the cashier knew how to treat the situation as they should have almost mocked and the worst of all is that the administrator of the establishment was there (yes, I know who you are) and He didn't even have the one to verify what was happening, being a client who just consumed you and frequents often\n",
      "I don't think he will return to his business anymore.\n",
      "Because it is not a mistake that changes my perception, what changed it was the lack of humanity and quality of human being that would not allow me to return there. Thank you very much for your previous services that we already pay for very well, but we will not need them anymore.\n",
      "Success.\n",

      "Llevo visitando el Lugar mucho tiempo en grupos grandes y muchas veces solo con mi pareja por que nos gusta salir a cenar..y si me da tiempo en mi lunch los visito.\n",
      "Esta ocasión tuvimos una muy grande decepción con su servicio, con su tacto y con sus actos, los cuales creo que fueron de muy mal gusto. Me explico.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pedimos una comida para llevar por teléfono, ya que estábamos visitando el lugar en nuestra hora del almuerzo, osea 1 hora el plan principal era ir recoger y regresar.\n",
      "Al salir del trabajo para ir a buscar la comida otros empleados se antojaron de comer de allí y les dejamos saber que les haríamos el favor de pedir sus comidas cuando fuésemos a recoger la nuestra, Llego donde la cajera, le explicó que tengo otra orden que pedir, que quería hacer un pedido para allí mismo(queso frito) y que tenía otras órdenes que pedir para llevar. Ella me explica que para pedir el queso frito tengo que pedirlo en la mesa, que me cobraría lo que ya ordenamos y luego yo pasara a sentarme a la mesa para ordenar el queso frito, que de vez haga las ordenes que tengo para llevarme a la mesera, que ella me las toma como to go, y pagamos la primera orden(aún así cuando pagué les brinde propina pues por la costumbre ya que fui mesera se lo que es el trabajo por propina y soy muy conciente con los empleados en cada lugar que visito)\n",
      "Cuando nos sentamos en la mesa luego de pagar nuestra primera orden,\n",
      "La mesera con muy mala actitud desde 1ras y el mesero se miraron con caras raras, luego se cuchicharon entre sí,\n",
      "se pararon frente a la cajera y comenzaron a hablar entre ellos, me trae los cubiertos y le pedimos 2 coca colas y un queso frito y digo que tenía unas ordenes que hacer to go.\n",
      "En ese momento todos se miran unos a otros y se dirige la cajera a nosotras 2 y nos dice que no podíamos comernos lo de nuestra compra anterior allí, que si lo habíamos ordenado por teléfono teníamos que consumirlo fuera del establecimiento y el mesero nos trae un papel que lo dice(que lo ví solo cuando lo trajo por que ni cuenta nos dimos del papel sino no paso semejante bochorno)que esa era una nueva ley de ellos, que si quería comerme el queso frito allí lo podía ordenar pero que no podía sacar nada de la orden anterior y que si queríamos podíamos comernos en el carro o fuera del establecimiento mientras esperábamos por las otras órdenes pero sin consumir las que ya teníamos allí, osea, dejando que nuestras órdenes se enfriaran.\n",
      "Yo muy amablemente, me levanté del asiento les dije que muchas gracias a todos que de veras no teníamos el conocimiento de la nueva regla, no habíamos visto el papel y que no lo sabíamos(por que ni te lo dejan saber al llegar al establecimiento antes de pagar,  ni por el teléfono te dicen la regla, aún nosotras explicando lo que queríamos hacer no nos lo dicen hasta que tomamos asiento)\n",
      "Bueno....no nos quedó de otra, nos fuimos le deje saber que ya no me interesaba hacer ninguna otra compra ni hacer las ordenes para llevar por que no comería en mi carro, ni dejaría que la comida se me enfriará, salimos mi compañeray  yo con caras de vergüenza por que prácticamente nos botaron del establecimiento delante de todos.\n",
      "Creo que fue de muy mal gusto la manera en la que se dirigieron a nosotras y la forma en la que lidiaron con la situación, me hicieron sentir pésimo, como si hubiesemos llevado comida de otro lugar(un macdonalds o un bk) para comer allí cuando éramos consumidoras de una forma u otra.Realmente ni la mesera, ni el mesero, ni la cajera supieron tratar la situación como debieron casi mofándose y lo peor de todo es que el adminitrador del establecimiento estaba allí(sí,se quien eres) y ni siquiera tuvo el aquel de verificar que sucedía, siendo yo una clienta que te acaba de consumir y que frecuenta seguido\n",
      "No creo que regrese a su negocio nunca más.\n",
      "Por que no es un error lo que cambia mi percepción, lo que la cambió fue la falta de humanidad y calidad de ser humano lo que no m permitiría volver allí.  Muchas gracias por sus servicios anteriores que muy bien ya los pagamos, pero ya no los necesitaremos más.\n",
      "Éxito.\n"
